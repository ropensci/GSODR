Description: Download, clean and reformat weather data from USA National
    Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather
    stations,
    <https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod>.
    The function, get_GSOD(), retrieves data from the GSOD ftp site and
    reformats it from United States Customary System (USCS) units to
    International System of Units (SI), also for convenience elevation is
    converted from decimetres to metres. Stations are individually checked for
    number of missing days, as defined by the user, to assure data quality.
    Stations with too many missing observations are omitted from final file.
    Stations with missing latitude or longitude or values for both of 0 are
    omitted. Also omitted are stations with a latitude of < -90 or > 90 or
    longitude of < - 180 or > 180. Output is returned as a comma-separated
    values (CSV) file written to disk in a location selected by the user, which
    summarises each year by station and includes new variables: actual and
    saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity calculated from the original
    GSOD data. The resulting files can be as large as 500mb depending on the
    user's stringency for missing data and geographic area of interest. Be sure
    to have sufficient RAM and disk space as well as a reasonably fast internet
    connection to use this package to perform this operation. However, for much
    smaller and more manageable data sets, an individual country of interest may
    be selected as well as only stations falling between -60/60 degrees latitude
    for agroclimatology work. The resulting files include station data (e.g.,
    station name, country, latitude, longitude, elevation) for use in a
    geographic information system (GIS). The function was largely based on
    T. Hengl's 'getGSOD.R' script, available from
    <http://spatial-analyst.net/book/system/files/getGSOD.R> with enhancements
    to be more cross-platform, faster and more flexible. Currently flags are
    maintained for all of the columns except for MIN/MAX. In the original
    MIN/MAX columns of the GSOD data, "blank indicates max temp was taken from
    the explicit max temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. * indicates max
    temp was derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or
    synoptic-reported temperature).", GSOD readme.txt
    <http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt>. For CSV files
    resulting from GSODR the flags are stripped.
