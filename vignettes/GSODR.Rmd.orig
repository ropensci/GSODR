# Introduction

The GSOD or [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516) data provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) are a valuable source of weather data with global coverage.
However, the data files are cumbersome and difficult to work with.
_GSODR_ aims to make it easy to find, transfer and format the data you need for use in analysis and provides four main functions for facilitating this:

- `get_GSOD()` - this function queries and transfers files from the NCEI's webpage, reformats them and returns a tidy data frame in R.

- `reformat_GSOD()` - this function takes individual station files from the local disk and re-formats them returning a tidy data frame in R.

- `nearest_stations()` - this function returns a vector of station IDs that fall within the given radius (kilometres) of a point given as latitude and longitude in order from nearest to farthest.

- `update_station_list()` - this function downloads the latest station list from the NCEI's server updates the package's internal database of stations and their metadata.

- `get_inventory()` - this function downloads the latest station inventory information from the NCEI's server and returns the header information about the latest version as a message in the console and a data frame of the stations' inventories for each year and month that data are reported.

When reformatting data either with `get_GSOD()` or `reformat_GSOD()`, all units are converted from United States Customary System (USCS) to International System of Units (SI), _e.g._, inches to millimetres and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Data in the R session summarise each year by station, which also includes vapour pressure and relative humidity elements calculated from existing data in GSOD.

For more information see the description of the data provided by NCEI, <https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt>.

# Using get_GSOD()

## Find Stations in or near Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia

_GSODR_ provides lists of weather station locations and elevation values.
It's easy to find all stations in Australia.

```{r Ex1, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library("GSODR")

load(system.file("extdata", "isd_history.rda", package = "GSODR"))

# create data.frame for Australia only
Oz <- subset(isd_history, COUNTRY_NAME == "AUSTRALIA")

Oz

# Look for a specific town in Australia
subset(Oz, grepl("TOOWOOMBA", NAME))
```

## Download a Single Station and Year Using get_GSOD()

Now that we've seen where the reporting stations are located, we can download weather data from the station Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia for 2010 by using the STNID in the `station` parameter of `get_GSOD()`.

```{r Ex2, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
tbar <- get_GSOD(years = 2010, station = "955510-99999")
str(tbar)
```

## Using nearest_stations() to Download Multiple Stations at Once

Using the `nearest_stations()` function, you can find stations closest to a given point specified by latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
This can be used to generate a vector to pass along to `get_GSOD()` and download the stations of interest.

```{r Ex3, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
tbar_stations <- nearest_stations(LAT = -27.5598,
                                  LON = 151.9507,
                                  distance = 50)

tbar <- get_GSOD(years = 2010, station = tbar_stations)
str(tbar)
```

## Plot Maximum and Minimum Temperature Values

Using the first data downloaded for a single station, 955510-99999, plot the
temperature for 2010.

```{r Ex5, eval=TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align = "center", fig.path = "vignettes/", message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("tidyr")

# Create a dataframe of just the date and temperature values that we want to
# plot
tbar_temps <- tbar[, c("YEARMODA", "TEMP", "MAX", "MIN")]

# Gather the data from wide to long
tbar_temps <-
  pivot_longer(tbar_temps, cols = TEMP:MIN, names_to = "Measurement")

ggplot(data = tbar_temps, aes(x = YEARMODA,
                              y = value,
                              colour = Measurement)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", na.value = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Temperature") +
  scale_x_date(name = "Date") +
  ggtitle(label = "Max, min and mean temperatures for Toowoomba, Qld, AU",
          subtitle = "Data: U.S. NCEI GSOD") +
  theme_classic()
```

# Using reformat_GSOD()

You may have already downloaded GSOD data or may just wish to use your browser to download the files from the server to you local disk and not use the capabilities of `get_GSOD()`.
In that case the `reformat_GSOD()` function is useful.

There are two ways, you can either provide `reformat_GSOD()` with a list of specified station files or you can supply it with a directory containing all of the "STATION.csv" station files or "YEAR.zip" annual files that you wish to reformat.

**Note** _Any_ .csv file provided to `reformat_GSOD()` will be imported, if it is not a GSOD data file, this will lead to an error.
Make sure the directory and file lists are clean.

## Reformat a List of Local Files

In this example two STATION.csv files are in subdirectories of user's home directory and are listed for reformatting as a string.

```{r Ex6, eval=FALSE}
y <- c("~/GSOD/gsod_1960/20049099999.csv",
       "~/GSOD/gsod_1961/20049099999.csv")
x <- reformat_GSOD(file_list = y)
```

## Reformat all Local Files Found in Directory

In this example all STATION.csv files in the sub-folder GSOD/gsod_1960 will be imported and reformatted.

```{r Ex16, eval=FALSE}
x <- reformat_GSOD(dsn = "~/GSOD/gsod_1960")
```

# Using update_station_list()

_GSODR_ uses internal databases of station data from the NCEI to provide location and other metadata, _e.g._ elevation, station names, WMO codes, etc. to make the process of querying for weather data faster.
This database is created and packaged with _GSODR_ for distribution and is updated with new releases.
Users have the option of updating these databases after installing _GSODR_.
While this option gives the users the ability to keep the database up-to-date and gives _GSODR's_ authors flexibility in maintaining it, this also means that reproducibility may be affected since the same version of _GSODR_ may have different databases on different machines.
If reproducibility is necessary, care should be taken to ensure that the version of the databases is the same across different machines.

The database file `isd_history.rda` can be located on your local system by using the following command, `paste0(.libPaths(), "/GSODR/extdata")[1]`, unless you have specified another location for library installations and installed _GSODR_ there, in which case it would still be in `GSODR/extdata`.

To update _GSODR's_ internal database of station locations simply use `update_station_list()`, which will update the internal station database according to the latest data available from the NCEI.

```{r Ex7, eval=FALSE}
update_station_list()
```

# Using get_inventory()

_GSODR_ provides a function, `get_inventory()` to retrieve an inventory of the number of weather observations by station-year-month for the beginning of record through to current.

Following is an example of how to retrieve the inventory and check a station in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, which was used in an earlier example.

```{r Ex18, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
inventory <- get_inventory()

inventory

subset(inventory, STNID %in% "955510-99999")
```

Missing = `NA`;

- **MAX\_ATTRIBUTES** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max temp report and not from the 'hourly' data.
An "\*" indicates max temp was derived from the hourly data (_i.e._, highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);

- **MIN** - Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day.

A value of ".00" indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).
Missing = NA;
*Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation-- therefore, `NA` will often appear on these days.
For example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell.*
See `FLAGS_PRCP` column for source of data;

- **PRCP\_ATTRIBUTES** -

    - A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;

    - F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;

    - G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;

    - H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (*e.g.* from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day;

    - I = Station did not report any precipitation data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported;

- **SNDP** - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;
