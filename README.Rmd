# _GSODR_: Global Summary Daily Weather Data in R

## Introduction to _GSODR_

The GSOD or
[Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
data provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) are a valuable source of weather data with global coverage.
However, the data files are cumbersome and difficult to work with.
_GSODR_ aims to make it easy to find, transfer and format the data you
need for use in analysis and provides four main functions for
facilitating this:

- `get_GSOD()`, queries and transfers files from the FTP server,
    reformats them and returns a `tibble()` object in R session and/or
    saves a file to disk with options for a GeoPackage spatially enabled
    file or comma `separated values (CSV) file,

- `reformat_GSOD()`, the workhorse, takes individual station files on
    the local disk and reformats them, returns a `tibble()` object
    in R session or saves a file to disk with options for a GeoPackage
    spatially enabled file or comma separated values (CSV) file,

- `nearest_stations()`, returns a `vector()` object containing a list
    of stations and their metadata that fall within the given radius of
    a point specified by the user,

- `update_station_list()`, downloads the latest station list from the
    NCEI FTP server updates the package's internal database of stations
    and their metadata.

When reformatting data either with `get_GSOD()` or `reformat_GSOD()`,
all units are converted to International System of Units (SI), e.g.,
inches to millimetres and Fahrenheit to Celsius. File output can be
saved as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file or in a spatial GeoPackage
(GPKG) file, implemented by most major GIS software, summarising each
year by station, which also includes vapour pressure and relative
humidity elements calculated from existing data in GSOD.

Additional data are calculated by this R package using the original data and
included in the final data. These include vapour pressure (ea and es) and
relative humidity.

It is recommended that you have a good Internet connection to download the data
files as they can be quite large and slow to download.

For more information see the description of the data provided by NCEI,
<http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt>.

## Quick Start Install

### Stable Version

A stable version of _GSODR_ is available from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GSODR).

```r
install.packages("GSODR")
```

### Development Version

A development version is available from from GitHub. If you wish to
install the development version that may have new features or bug fixes before the CRAN version does (but also may
not work properly), please install the
[devtools package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools),
available from CRAN. We strive to keep the master branch on GitHub functional
and working properly.

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/GSODR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using _GSODR_

### Query the NCEI FTP server for GSOD data

_GSODR's_ main function, `get_GSOD()`, downloads and cleans GSOD data
from the NCEI server. Following are a few examples of its capabilities.

#### Example - Download weather station data for Toowoomba, Queensland for 2010

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(GSODR)

tbar <- get_GSOD(years = 2010, station = "955510-99999")

tbar
```

## Other Sources of Weather Data in R

There are several other sources of weather data and ways of retrieving
them through R. Several are also [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) projects.

[_rnoaa_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnoaa), from
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) offers tools for interacting with and
downloading weather data from the United States National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration but lacks support for GSOD data.

[_bomrang_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bomrang), from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) provides functions to interface with Australia
Government Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) data, fetching data and returning a tidy
data frame of précis forecasts, current weather data from stations, agriculture
bulletin data, BoM 0900 or 1500 weather bulletins or a raster stack object of satellite imagery from GeoTIFF files. Data (c) Australian Government Bureau of
Meteorology Creative Commons (CC) Attribution 3.0 licence or Public Access
Licence (PAL) as appropriate. See <http://www.bom.gov.au/other/copyright.shtml>
for further details.

[_riem_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=riem) from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) allows to get weather data from Automated
Surface Observing System (ASOS) stations (airports) in the whole world thanks to
the Iowa Environment Mesonet website.

[_CliFlo_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clifro) from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org)
is a web portal to the New Zealand National Climate Database and provides public
access (via subscription) to around 6,500 various climate stations (see
<https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/> for more information). Collating and manipulating
data from CliFlo (hence clifro) and importing into R for further analysis, exploration and visualisation is now straightforward and coherent. The user is
required to have an internet connection, and a current CliFlo subscription
(free) if data from stations, other than the public Reefton electronic weather
station, is sought.

[_weatherData_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=weatherData) provides a selection of functions to fetch weather data from Weather Underground and return it as a clean data frame. 

## Other Sources for Fetching GSOD Weather Data

The
[_GSODTools_](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/GSODTools)
by [Florian Detsch](https://github.com/fdetsch) is an R package that
offers similar functionality as _GSODR_, but also has the ability to
graph the data and working with data for time series analysis.

The [_ULMO_](https://github.com/ulmo-dev/ulmo) library offers an
interface to retrieve GSOD data using Python.

## Notes

### Other Data Sources

#### Elevation Values

90m hole-filled SRTM digital elevation (Jarvis _et al._ 2008) was used
to identify and correct/remove elevation errors in data for station
locations between -60˚ and 60˚ latitude. This applies to cases here
where elevation was missing in the reported values as well. In case the
station reported an elevation and the DEM does not, the station reported
is taken. For stations beyond -60˚ and 60˚ latitude, the values are
station reported values in every instance. See
<https://github.com/ropensci/GSODR/blob/master/data-raw/fetch_isd-history.md>
for more detail on the correction methods.

#### WMO Resolution 40. NOAA Policy

_Users of these data should take into account the following (from the [NCEI website](http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdoselect.cmd?datasetabbv=GSOD&countryabbv=&georegionabbv=)):_

> "The following data and products may have conditions placed on their

> Re-distribution of these data by others must provide this same
